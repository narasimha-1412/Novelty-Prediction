0,"Wow what an amazing walk on the Great Wall of China, amazing view from each look out points along the wall, November weather was fantastic while we were there.",0
1,"I came to spend 2 hours between 2 professional meetings, I really enjoyed this large beach, the water is turquoise, there were a lot of very beautiful girls",0
2,A MUST visit in one's life. History and Art from the Byzantium Empire still kept in good shape. The chandeliers are glowing like they used to centuries ago. The mosaic speaks to you in many ways. Mesmerizing experience!,1
3,"It's was very peaceful and beautiful, go with a guide to explain the history and everything about it, really nicee pictures",0
4,It is beautiful lake in all seasons. Beautiful in summer to swim in and stunning in winter to enjoy its tranquility.,0
5,"The iconic square is located by St. Mark's Basillica. Restaurants and shops outline the square, the price is more.  There are museums and attractions in and around the square. The only way to get to San Marco is by water transport  or walk.",0
6,Our hotel was near the shops and river hotel ibis strasbourg centre petite france we walked round very busy but pretty and looking at all the restaurants to have something to eat plenty of places and lots of choice .We went to steakhouse district and had steak meal and also,1
7,"Really nice beaches, nice wooden walk along the colorful Lifeguard houses. The water is very nice, mind the flags for bathing information!",0
8,"First time inside Hagia Sophia after it became a mosque. Easy access, no entrance fee, very peaceful. Floor covered in carpet inside prayer hall.",0
9,Great piece of engineering and very well maintained. Lots of choices in the surroundings shops and restaurant.,1
10,"Very nice place to relax. Good range of attractions and amazing views. Also a good hub in central switzerland if you plan to venture further into the country. But can be overly crowded. If you are looking for a very relaxing, quiet and serene place, I would recommend Weggis which is about 45 mins ferry ride from Luzern. Costs in Weggis are also lower than Luzern.  Highly recommended and would return.",0
11,"There is very little I can write, by way of giving information, that isn't already widely available across the internet, so I'll stick to personal advice and experience. The ""At The Top"" experience can be booked up to 28 days in advance and I'd strongly recommend doing that. It can avoid hours of queueing on the day. You can also add the option of a virtual reality experience and I'd also recommend that.  The experience begins with a journey to the 125th floor in the fastest elevator I've ever been in, yet you have no real sensation of the speed when inside. It's only when you get there, and look down from the viewing platform, that you realise how far you have travelled in such a short space of time. There is a photographer offering the usual professional shots that you think you'll never buy, but they were so good that we did buy several of them. However, you can also capture many great shots with your own camera, so be sure to remember to take it with you. I'll attach several of my own to this review.",1
12,You can by a pass for historical sites and rush the lane on it. Do not forget about sun - take a covers.,0
13,"It’s a 15-minute ferry ride to this island from the Market Square marina. (I think I paid €3 roundtrip mid-week.) Ferries are frequent, and signage at both ends makes the schedule very clear. It’s a fairly good-sized set of islands connected by bridges with paved or well travelled dirt paths crossing them all. It’s very pleasant to walk around and take photos— I especially liked exploring the old armaments and fortifications.  I didn’t pay to enter the museum, and otherwise didn’t find much to DO there. (There is a small market for food and drinks.)  But if you’re content with some scenic strolling, or finding a perch to take in the atmosphere, then this is a pleasant place to spend a couple hours. If time is limited and you can choose only one, take the ferry to Tallinn instead.",0
14,Very nice  medieval surroundings - lots of restaurants - the best "au pont St. Martin"  The canals around could need a cleaning - but still a good experience.,1
15,On a bone-chilling windy wednesday of March we had a nice trip back and forth to these amazing islands and a guided tour of the fortess. The latter is absolutely recommend for a greater understanding of the dramatic history of Finland,0
16,"So the entrance here is not free so be sure to purchase a museem pass if you plan to visit them all it works out a lot cheaper.  This place is amazing set across two levels you get fantastic views of everything and Ii could have spent several hours in here.It has a mix of religions which is very interesting,  I fell in love with this place.",1
17,"a month ago Phenomenal Experience!!! It's not just tallest, it's Gorgeous too. You would not like to go away from this area. The experience you would love from the outside on the ground is far better than to go up to the 125th floor. The building looks a giant beauty from the area where Dubai fountains are!! Go in the evening to have a better experience. Dubai mall is close to the building so you spend a day in shopping then enjoy the evening over here!!!",1
18,"This is such an amazing place and a must visit when in Rome, If you look down at the arena you can just imagine what went on there, so much history.  It’s situated in the town which I did not expect.  A must visit",0
19,"Very economical and fortunately not very crowded the day I visited.  You need to wear hiking boots, if possible.  There are plenty of places to stop and rest as needed.  I took the ski lift partially up, walked 94 floors up and down and then took the slide the remainder of the way down.  The slide is a BLAST and should be experienced by all.  Like most public places in China, bring toilet tissue with you.",1
20,"This was a bucket list check.  I have wanted to go to the top since it was built.  We went to the 125 floor.  My visit was pre COVID.  I was very disappointed. It was super crowded and the viewing windows were not clean.  The views were incredible, of the night sky, but was difficult to get good pictures through dirty windows.  It was very pricy as well.",0
21,Elevator ride up has video screens  and graphics that add to the feeling of riding 124 stories in a minute. Beware.  Going all the way to the top is very expensive. 124th floor is more affordable and view is great.,0
22,"I have visited this area twice and have been fortunate to have enjoyed beautiful weather on both occasions. A cruise on the tranquil lake under these conditions is a restful, even euphoric experience and the cost is very reasonable. All in all, the lake and its surrounds are picturesque and enjoyable with great walks and things to do.",1
23,I've been there many times in the last 10 years and every time I visit  I get impressed still by the show of music and lights. Recommended to arrive get a good place and wait for 2-3 shows or a restaurant across.,1
24,"We enjoyed being close to the old quarter. We felt park of the local experience, walking alongside the street vendors and bring close to the Lake.",1
25,There are several parts of the wall you can visit when in Beijing. We were recommended  Mutianyu and it did not disappoint. The scenery is stunning and my colleague and I really enjoyed the walk. Highly recommended!,1
26,If you want the hustle and bustle of hanoi. Then you need to stay here. All the pubs club and stuff to do. Right in there. Easy to walk to attractions. Can be a bit Noisey but that's why your visiting hanoi.,0
27,"We saw the city in the evening, absolutely must see part of the trip. Bit chilly but emotions will warm you up!",1
28,This Internationally Acclaimed Iconic Sky high Tower needs no introduction. A Must see for every Resident & Visitor to UAE.,0
29,"I love South Beach and wish I have allotted more time to stay.  I stayed here for 4 nights and simply enjoyed this.  I strolled along the beach, visited the Art Deco area, enjoyed the abundant restaurants and drinks along the beach and simply had a great time.",1
30,"Getting the ferry over to Suomenlinna was relatively easy.  Tickets are available through the HSL app, or you can get them at the pier. It’s about 15 minutes to the island, from the South Harbour.  The island itself, still has inhabitants, but it’s great to walk through the buildings or among the coast edge - explore the battery ruins, cannons and bunkers as well as old barracks.  I also realised, it’s an amazing location to see breathtaking sunsets over Helsinki.",0
31,"Place that is great, remained here three nights. Website traffic is insane, the street is as a sea of mopeds, it's a leap of faith when crossing the street! They actually ride on the pavements! Though it's an incredible site, every block offers various products, therefore in case you desired a digital camera you will visit the Camera or maybe perhaps electrical street. Restaurants are abundant in which you are able to get a banh mi along with a beer at insane low prices. The Lake is a great place to stroll around and chill out.",0
32,"During these very difficult times, I can stop but think of how amazing Venice and Piazza San Marco was last August ! Hold on there beautiful Italy, we will be back soon !!",0
33,One the new 7 wonders of the world. Very busy attraction so get there early in the day. Have a search for a skip the line guided tour or just a ticket as queues looked very long.,0
34,"First time been to Hanoi and was very surprised how lively the city is.   It’s a must to walk in the old quarter area, you can smell the amazing food everywhere and the people are very friendly and nice.",1
35,South beach is a world famous special location The beach is beautiful. The boardwalk is wide and comfortable. The people are beautiful.,0
36,A really beautiful area of Strasbourg with lots of history and charm. One of the most beautiful French cities I have seen.,0
37,"Being in the old quarter of Hanoi was a fantastic experience, sampling all the great food and walking around the street markets finding nooks and crannies to see their culture played out before our eyes. Helped that our son lives and teaches there, so he knows the language, which of course amazed the older Vietnamese people and caused for a great banter between them. Loved to ride motorbikes through the streets in horrendous traffic that all seemed to flow very well. Loved Hanoi and can’t wait to go back.",1
38,"I went there with family and Freinds, something very interesting to check Dubai from almost the sky... I bought a voucher from Groupon better than paying full price on spot..",1
39,"Try several boat or ferry exercution from Lucern Train/ Bus station. They also have evening 7:12 PM steam boat trip for 2:15 min from pier 1.  Try to go or come with Ferry from Vitznau (after trip from Mt. Rigi), which oncludedbin Swiss travel pass.",0
40,This is an amazing building considering its age and how its stood the ravages of time. The size humbles you considering when it was built. Shame about the length of time its taking to complete the renovations though.,0
41,Just a wonderful boat ride on Lake Lucerne. Views of all the mountains peaks all around. Hard not to take a lot of pictures.,0
42,This section of The Great Wall of China is nicely refurbished and is quite a site. We approached by shuttle bus and cable car up to the access point. Then walked up to the wall up steep stairs. It is a amazing place to visit and be able to observe.,0
43,"You should do this at least once if you travel to Dubai more frequently, buy the ticket in advance online. Great views and great story behind this building and how it was created.",0
44,Very picturesque part of Strasbourg. Combination of water and old well kept buildings is always nice. Despite this being February and grey our walk through the old part of the city was most enjoyable. I am sure it is even nicer and more beautiful in the summer or during the Christmas market. That is to be found out hopefully.,1
45,This museum has an outstanding history and is truly a sight to see. Pay the fee to enter whether or not you decide on the guided tour.,0
46,We took boat ride on the way to Mt. Pilatus through Lake Luzern. One can identify Mt. Rigi and Mt Pilatus from distance. Clear blue colour water surrounded by green mountains and clear sky was just mesmerizing. I think this is the most beautiful lake in Switzerland.,0
47,"Located in the ""Western part"" of Strasbourg's ""Grand Isle"" lies this masterpiece of history.  UNESCO has awarded it, in 1988, its ""World Heritage Designation""...  The ambience is reflective of the 16th Century buildings and roadworks construction {made of ""cobblestones""}.  There are ever so many ""fine details"" which will ""excite one's imagination"" as well as contribute substantially to one's memories of the small to Medium sized city.  Strasbourg's ""rich history"" and economic evolution is displayed...  TripAdvisor has also awarded it the coveted ""Certificate of Excellence"".  It is also one of the most highly rated (by travellers like you and I) attractions in Strasbourg.  Definitely worthy of a visit- both to the city as well as this ""historical district"".I hope that this Review has been helpful.",1
48,"?????,?????? ???????,???????? ???????/??? Very good tour guide, good in both mandarin and English. He will explain in details and bring the group nicely. Recommend to look him for tour guide.",0
49,"Another please i spent so much time at during my trip to Miami, beautiful beach, people and excellent places to chill",0
50,This place is definitely worth visiting.  What a privilege to walk in what was originally a cathedral which was constructed in  AD 300 and to meditate on the history and the people who have passed thru those doors!,1
51,"The six islands of Suomenlinna are a 25 minute ferry trip from Helsinki, and can only be reached by sea. This impressive maritime fortress once protected the shipping lanes into Helsinki. Today it has a diverse range of attractions for the visitor . . . ramparts, cannons, tunnels, and museums. The network of pathways provide access to cultured gardens, undisturbed greenery, sea views,and secluded beaches. Cafes and restaurants too are available.",1
52,"This mosque has an interesting history as it has been used as a Christian church as well as a Muslim mosque. It used to be a museum (you used to have to pay to get in) but has been turned back into a place of worship. It is richly decorated - walls, domes, stained glass windows.",1
53,We were in Helsinki for one day as part of our Baltic Sea cruise and the trip out to this fortress were a few hours well spent. It is a short ferry ride from Helsinki harbor to an island with lots of areas to explore. We spent a couple of hours walking around and enjoyed all the sights. We also enjoyed a beer in a quaint beer garden. I would highly recommend it if you have a day in Helsinki.,1
54,"My visit at the tallest skyscraper of the world it was impressive, because is neat, sharp at the end, and to look at his entire shape from bottom to the top is quite impressive. It is the tallest and very luxury building, worthed the visit on top to appreciate the stunning view.",0
55,We had a beautiful day on the lake. We took the ferry to a small town half way up the lake from Brunnen. A nice stroll to a great restaurant. Food was terrific! Then back to catch the next ferry and another scenic trip along the lake back to Brunnen. Well worth the price.,1
56,In my opinion the best attraction in Rome. So much history and perfectly preserved. Hard to imagine what actually went on here. Awesome place,0
57,"About 7 years I’ve been coming to south beach exploring all the areas Incredible energy,diversity, great beach and bike paths for miles I never get tired of perfect weather ,beautiful ocean , many things to do from great food , boating , shows etc",0
58,"Istanbul's magnificent cathedral was a major religious site in Christianity and Islam, but it had also become a museum ... it’s very interesting & beautiful architecture to see.",1
59,We did a guided tour because we were unfamiliar with the ticketing process so we had to do it this way. I would definitely recommend a tour. We did a mid-level one (without going to the lower levels) and it was perfectly adequate and enjoyable. Any citizen of the world needs to make a pilgrimage here!,1
60,Miles of hard packed sand for walking and beautiful water. Great people watching too.  The water is really clean just as nice as the west coast but warmer.,0
61,Had a one hour cruise on this lovely lake from Lucerne in a panoramic yacht . Totally magical experience,1
62,"Walked just the outside on recommendations from others. Impressive ruin which is undergoing some restoration...scaffolding, tarps, etc. Great views from across street on top of the 'metro' station building. Beautiful in early AM and at sunset.",1
63,I did not know anything about this museum before we went. To say i was blown away is an understatement. I truly love how different religions share the same space in happiness. Inspiring is not  a strong enough word. Is defiantly a must,0
64,"This is the perfect time of year for the snow birds to escape to Miami. Great time of year to avoid the extreme heat. But the weather is very pleasant 70s and 80s. The most unique thing about this beach compared other beaches is the Lifeguard shacks. Glad those good boys have them too, always seems breezy here for what I hear and experience. The sand on the beaches is very soft and well kept up by the cleaning crews and the sunrises dont get any better.",1
65,We took a cruise for 1 hour (Free with Swiss pass) and it was a splendid experience. Take out some time and enjoy the view.,1
66,Had the chance to see it when i went to Dubai mall and the fountains. True luxury and gives you the goose bumps. Art and beauty in one piece.,0
67,Great price I would recommend anyone looking for a great and deal and feel at home property to check out Sunbright Apts,1
68,"I’ve been to Rome several times due to work and family business and always ,always go to the colosseum ,it’s just beautiful",0
69,"We visited Venice in late December after the 2019 floods.  No sign of damage or mud or anything.  The plaza was still decorated for the holidays, and all was well!",1
70,This being the main square with multiple attractions was jammed with people!  We did not have any issues with pick pockets per se but be aware that people just stop right in front of you to take pics/selfies without consideration for who may be behind them.  There are lots of pigeons and gulls and gulls eat pigeons if given the opportunity.  With that being said there are also numerous places to eat and shop in the arcades around the main square but be wary of paying a premium for the luxury.  You might as well see the sights here as the palace and the basilica are in the same place but I would do my shopping and eating a few streets away.,0
71,It is absolutely breathtaking.  The views are gorgeous. The town people are all very friendly and very English friendly.  Cannot wait to return.,0
72,"Easy to reach island from Helsinki market Square. Island itself is beautiful, it helped that it was a nice sunny day.We diverged from the route a few times to explore the island a little more. Overall it took us a couple of hours to complete the mile long route.",0
73,"It’s a good ferry ride to the island, however don’t go if it’s dark, can’t see anything. It’s a nice trails walk along the shores in the days time. Ask the ferry ride is included in the day pass",0
74,"First time visited in December - love the smaller crowds although the gadget and rose sellers are more desperate than usual, resulting in tugged jackets...beautiful place, all the same. Beware the 11% commission exchange bureau on the corner.",0
75,Love South Beach! All kinds of people! Good shopping! Good restaurants and bars! And lovely Beach! Everything within short walkingdistance.,1
76,The Ayasofia is simply breathtaking and a wonderful reminder that Christianity and Islam can live together in one house. I'm all the richer for this visit.,0
77,"It is in the neighborhood of Miami Beach. We parked at Nikki Beach parking lot (10$/24hr) on 1st St. and spent the whole day on the beach. Waves were rough today but water was green, clear and nice breeze. You can walk a bit further to South Point Pier and have a good view of the city.",0
78,"The Colosseum is the most beautiful museum I have ever seen. You have to wait a long time to get into there, but when you get into you will see all the ancient Rome. If you like museums you should visit it!!",0
79,"The JT Line Ferry ran about every 20 minutes taking about 20-30 minutes to cross. The journey was itself a pleasure. Third stop and you are there. The fortress is a group of islands which you can walk between which are covered with gun points, walls, barracks etc on pretty islands. I’d recommend a tour to explain what you are seeing. It takes about three hours to explore. You need trainers or similar as the cobbles are uneven. There are good cafes and restaurants on the islands.",1
80,"Lake Lucerne is a great place to visit.  It is calm, serene and extremely clean.  Take a ride on any of the boats that tour the lake and you will appreciate the beauty of the lake and the surrounding mountains!",1
81,"Our greatest recommendations to miss JANA at Arenatoursrome.com for at very, very good guidet tour around Colosseum. Her english was very easy to understand and she was an excellent communicator of italian history, so good that our teenage-girls (age 11, 15 and 17 years) were interested all the way around the tour.  We will recommend this guidet tour to all our friends.  Best regards, the family of 5 from Denmark.",1
82,I visited china second time just to see great china wall and was satisfied.But due to high blood pressure could not climb much but walked down as much as possible.A GREAT MOUNTAIN VIEW ALONGWITH STEPS OF WALL.The wall can be visited from different locations.Must see in Bejing,0
83,"We have a fantastic experience,got to have your imagination with you for this adventure. A remarkable place in history and when you have an excellent guide called Lumi from Purple Tours cant go wrong. She made it all come to life!",1
84,We took a boat ride and I was blown away by the intense colors of the water and how richly they reflected the surroundings. From the lake itself you get a completely different perspective of the charming towns and mountains.,0
85,"The views were stunning, no rush during our visit and great service! The visit was a little expensive but it’s Dubai so it’s worth it.",0
86,"Great beach, enjoyed bathing and swimmIng in exciting waves and natural sand safe in the knowledge that the excellent lifeguards are on hand in the event of need. First class,",0
87,"Less crowded and also quite challenging. Breath taking views! It's quite easy to visit, as the majority of the climbing is done by the gondola, which takes you up to an observation platform.",0
88,"Suomenlinna was a fortress and an army bastion, but today it's a lovely destination for travellers. If you have the time, Suomenlinna is an amazing place to wander and dream a day away...",0
89,"I live in Detroit and originally from Chicago, this area is declining very fast and seems to be getting dangerous and crime is a high possibility with the young immature and disrespectful young adults that don't have life experience. Be aware and stay safe, not a family destination. Sketchy crowd on the streets and throughout the whole beach. First time and will not go back due to safety concerns and hoodish type of atmosphere.",1
90,"Good place for shopping, local food. We did cyclo, joined night market and made friends with a lot of people. The locals are very friendly as well.",0
91,"chose the right timing (bet bevore the busses arrive) or try to pay for a shorter line if available. It's of course a must visting Rome but for me it was difficult to imagene how the games really happened, I missed a structural help or modells to explain. It's a preferable place when the sun is to hot cause of enough shadow areas.",0
92,"When you're on the wall, you think thaht it was made on kilometers and kilometers, you're very impressed.",0
93,"Being visiting Hagia Sophia in the time when it was Museum, I've been delighted how impressive and monumental it is!",0
94,We stayed here for 8 days in lucerne ... our hotel was right behind the lake lucerce with a view of lake...this is like best best i repeat best location to visit during evening time in lucernce...must to do,0
95,"The Burj Khalifa is one of those landmarks that you have to see for yourself. Pictures does not do this marvel of engineering, construction and design justice.",0
96,The best time to go to the Great Wall is 2 o'clock. The most of the tourists are already gone and we had fortress sections partly completely to ourselves in this time. And definitely book the toboggan run - it´s so fun!,1
97,We went to Muyianyu in the perfect timing. The weather was amazing around 25 degree and it was a nice breeze. It was not to much people and we just lived every second of it. There was plenty of stops eith drinks and toilets. The sad part is when tourists don't respect this historical place and they throw rubbish. It's so disrespectful and we got really upset when we saw trash here and there.,1
98,"This was a nice little excursion to spend an hour seeing some of the sites. No frills, and I don't remember any kind of narration of sites, but it was a novel way to get from one side of the lake to the other. We combined this with our trip to Mt.Pilatus.",1
99,After having read so much about the 8th Natural wonders of the world - this place is exactly how i imagined. I wish i had some time to hike which would be a great experience. It's also worth a visit in the fall the colours are just beautiful. if you are the adventurous kind then the cable car to the 14th tower and then a hike up to the 23rd tower. its steep and tough! there are other options to go up as well - there is chair lift to go up and down at the 6th tower or also an option of toboggan to come down ....its fun! overall definitely a visit,1
100,"Have visited many historic old towns around Europe, and the Petite France area of Strasbourg would have to be up there with the best for picturesque timber framed buildings gathered in narrow laneways around the lochs and waterways. Simply timeless. Reminded me of Bruges, one of my favourite other cities. Well worth a wander, with photo opportunities around every bend.",0
101,"It's very nice old town with a lots of small street covered by long range of shops , small hotel, restaurants and small old houses. we had very lovely walking here to stroll around and do shopping, eating...It was crowded place and nice place to see when you are in Hanoi.",1
102,We did a DIY tour using the free audio download app.  It was perfect for us.  We booked direct on the official website. Then downloaded the app for audio tour. It means you can go around at your own pace but still be informed of the sights and information. If you are going to go to the Colosseum then the Arena is a must. Incredible. We were lucky in that we did not have to mix with crowds due to covid times. We understand you cannot just turn up but must pre book.  Much cheaper to book direct.  We did not have to queue at all either. We chose to do the Forum and Palantine Hill first then the Colosseum - saved the best bit until last.,0
103,Lake Lucerne is such a gorgeous lake!  The downtown is a must.  We rented paddle boats.  The swans come up right to you.  It's a gorgeous place to spend an afternoon people watching.,0
104,"We had a great tour of the old quarter.  So much going and as it was the holidays, tons of Christmas decorations for sale.  Very festive.",1
105,"I always had good references about south beach, despite the current situation I was able to enjoy the beach.",0
106,"This is one of the largest and most beautiful squares in the world and a first-time visit to Venice will be incomplete without spending some time in the square. Several times a year, it gets completely flooded, so plan your trip carefully if you don't want to get caught up in the floods. This is apparently the lowest point in Venice above water. It is always crowded so keep your valuables close.",0
107,A lovely museum. Very interesting place to visit. Not a lot of children seen more for adults or older students  .,1
108,"A MUST GO place when you visit Dubai.  We had breakfast at the lounge, 154 floor up.  Amazing view of Dubai, so high that you can see the curvature of the land and sky.  Outdoor observatory decks on 124 floor, reservation recommended.",0
109,"Similar to all cities, the piazza is often crowded. The night view is beautiful. You can go a bit late at night for some good pictures. Early morning you will find it almost empty and also you can take some nice sunrise pictures",0
110,"Life happens on the sidewalks including grinding, welding, cooking and parking. Interesting to walk through and see.",1
111,"What is amazing is the clarity of the water and its colour, it is a see through blue green, it feels unreal . So beautiful",0
112,We explored on a very cold day and it was very windy so check the weather and dress accordingly! The cafes on the island are also great. Very fun day trip and fun to explore! There are even stone tunnels under some of the buildings!,0
113,"Enjoy walking around this picturesque area.  Lots of tourists.  Great for taking pictures of canals.   Many restaurants, shops, bakeries you won’t be bored.  It’s a beautiful area to stroll around.",1
114,"The views from the Great Wall have to been seen to be believed.  We didnt go as part of a group, just got a taxi from Beijing and it worked perfectly.  The Wall wasnt as busy as we anticipated.  Late October is an excellent time to go.",1
115,It is the best place to visit and fun thing to do.  Tina is an excellent guide that we had and flexible with the group.  We had three different type of activities to and from Great Wall and she accommodated to our please.  Tina you are the. Best!  Keep it up for good work!  See you again!,0
116,"Take one of the slower boat tours on the lake.  Takes approx 1 hour with commentary.  A lovely trip to see where the three lakes merge, something to see all the way along.",0
117,"Although expensive this is one thing you absolutely must do. The views are mind blowing, service is exceptional. Just make sure you pick a clear day",0
118,Best Tower Ever in Dubai I can't imagine how was beautiful to experience this tower and it's amazing view,1
119,"Great Wall of china is a beautiful historical places. you can visited this monument on Beijing china, there is so much history on Great Wall, you can ask people from there or you can search on google about this amazing wall. to go there you can use vehicle but I recommend you to use car not bus because the route is kinda meander and lunge.  I visited this place two years ago.its winter when I go there and the wind is so strong, I wore a triple jacket but still I can't feel my feet. because of the wind I can't enjoy the view, I only took 2 or 3 photos then I go back to bus. I regret not to explore more the place but if I remember the wind there is no way to stay longer in that place. I recommend you guys to go on spring, the view is really nice, I think you can get amazing photos.  Great Wall of china is Wonderfull, I like the wall design, it's unique and full of history. and it's better if you read the history first before visited. but yeah this place won't regret you.",0
120,"Walked around at the tail end of a major Arts show - there were still sand sculptures on the beach which were pretty cool.  There is a section dedicated for people to work out and exercise at - one of the busier places just off the beach.  Easy access from the main drag with lotsa families, couple and singles walking around.",0
121,Absolute must when visiting Rome We were lucky enough to go on a guided tour of six. Even though we had to wear masks due to COVID we felt completely safe. The place is amazing even though tarnished with men dying you can imagine the Romans excitement going to watch the fights Really enjoyed visiting this historic monument,0
122,The Hagia Sophia stems from times as Istanbul was still called Constantinople. This is a must see in Istanbul.,0
123,One word Overpriced.  4 drinks on average €60 .  If looking for food and drink go down one of the small streets.  Better foods and much much cheaper Very busy architecture very beautiful.Book the palace and church in advance to miss the queue.,0
124,One of the highlights of visiting China is to walk along the great wall. Can be busy and that is always the way with top attractions. Just take your time.,1
125,We took the boat across the lake in order to board the cog train up Mt Rigi. The boat ride was about an hour long and absolutely charming.,0
126,"Me and my partner booked a tour for the colosseum, forum and Palestine hill. We were very impressed by the tour and the monuments themselves. I cannot recommend coming here enough. I would advice you to book a tour to be able to understand and learn more about what happened at these monuments.",1
127,"Look for different access times to get better ticket prices. Ticket includes the aquarium and underwater zoo. At the top you will get coffee and refreshments (even un COVID times). Plenty of chances to get a photo set or even video from the staff there. At the moment, you can stay up there as long as you wish, as there are few visitors.",1
128,"Lake Lucerne is really clean, beautiful and panaromic. We took an hour cruise along the lake and sighted many beautiful hotels and luxury homes dotting the lake sides. It is also lovely to walk along the lake in the city.",0
129,"nothing like diving back 1500 years ,beautiful structure and christian are wall designs,must visit in a lifetime",0
130,My family visited Lake Luzern on Sunday...this place is definitely less busy than Zurich.  We even rented a motor boat out to the Lake for an hour ride.  Totally worth it.  The name of the boat place is SNG.  It's right across from to the train station. $65 for an hour.  There were 5 of us and it's better than renting a paddle boat.  I'd suggest going out with your picnic basket right before sunset so you can enjoy your dinner out by the lake before it gets dark.  The boat rental place closes @8 p.m.There's also Amorino Ice Cream store & eateries as you stroll along Lake Luzern.  I'd it's worth spending a day in Lake Luzern!,0
131,Lots of room to spread out.  Biggest beach I've ever been to.  Life guards are patrolling the area.  Great atmosphere.  Clear water,0
132,"Funky place, I loved it, cool underground music and saxophone live player and awesome huge margaritas and one more for free. I’ll keep going that place",0
133,"Felt this square was overrated. It plays on its fame. Fine architecture though, but far too many people crowd into the San Marco district and street vendors spoil the atmosphere. Looks nice at night when it is quieter.",0
134,"Full of history,anyone will be amazed of the beauty of Hagia Sofia.It barely remember you of a Christian Church and being the second time transformed into a Mosque it add to it so much uniqueness.",0
135,"It was super easy to get here using the ferry, and it was a relaxing experience. We started by going to the visitor center, then ate at Bastian Bistro. We did the whole recommended path and it took us about thirty minutes. However, the pathway was very uneven cobblestones—wear the right shoes! It was very relaxing to be there and quite a peaceful atmosphere.",1
136,Lake Lucerne was stunning. There were many places we could have visited in Switzerland and it was tough to choose. I am so glad we decided to visit Lucerne. It was so pretty and clean.,0
137,There are so many interesting buildings and historic towers. The area is crisscrossed with waterways and bridges. There are many restaurants with a variety of cuisines. A trip there at night makes for even more enjoyable sights with coloured lighting.,1
138,"The area comprised of a few streets is very charming but crowded with tourists and touristy shops. Had expected something else from Strasbourg, it was bigger than I thought and very spreaded.",0
139,Just get lost in the myriad streets and alleyways. Just watch out for scooters and cars. The sights and smells never stop!,0
140,We were short on time -so got the petit tren tour which is ideal. It takes you at a slow pace round La Petite France part of this lovely city. Whatever else - you must see this part. It is a time warp with very narrow streets/canals and half timbered houses from the 15-16 century -all well preserved.The streets are cobbled and the whole area is very picturesque In the Middle Ages it was home to the tanners/millers and fishermen and today is a world heritage site. There are many characterful eateries and bars to enjoy. You can also take a river/canal trip through the area.,1
141,We did a tour of Helsinki which included the fortress.  The history was interesting and the sites were beautiful.  We enjoyed it greatly.,1
142,"It’s definitely one of the must visit places in Istanbul,beautiful building, every detail was gorgeous, we took lots of pictures, it was like stepping in the past for a few moments",0
143,Piazza San Marco is the only piazza on Venice. The rest of the "squares" are called Campos. This one is large and crowded and a must see. But don't linger long. Go wander up the alleys and get lost and found. There is so much to see and do in Venice besides this piazza.  You can access the basilica or Doges palace from here.,1
144,"This was my 6th time in Istanbul, and during every of these travels I've visited Hagia Sophia, as I regard it as one of world's most famous and important edifices. This time it was a different experience. Hagia Sophia is an iconic world heritage edifice, built on orders of Emperor Justinian. It still holds the world record being built in only 5 years (532-537). It was the main and biggest Christian Church where many kings were crowned for almost a millennium, until the Ottomans came in 15c converting it into a Mosque. During the times of Ataturk reformations it was established as a museum in 1935 - and it was one of the world's best. My memories root in that period, when you had to queue in a long line outside, paying around 10 Euros entry fee and when you could admire outstanding frescoes and mosaics from 6th c onwards, along with Ottoman decorations added from 15c. It was a unique place in entire world (along with some Churches in Andalusia) where you could admire such a cultural and religious mix. This was until this year, when it was reestablished as a Mosque again in July. While the imposing exterior remained the same, the interior is much different. You cannot walk the multi centuries stone and marble floor, as it's completely covered with a green carpet (you must take off your shoes before entering). All amazing Byzantine frescoes and mosaics are covered in white sheets and you cannot see them, nor you can climb the upper gallery where there're more. Therefore I give 4 stars, otherwise I'd give 100. Now, there's no entry fee, you can walk in freely (except during prayer times), but I wish I still had to pay and see all these now hidden jewels I remember Hagia Sophia for. I enclose pics from my previous visit in 2012 and now, 2020 - catch the differences.",1
145,I loved this place so much. The best period to visit it is Christmas because the atmosphere is really particular!,1
146,"We spend a most enjoyable day on the islands, despite it being winter and somewhat bleak.  As first time visitors to this part of the world, we learnt  great deal about the history of the region, through understanding who build the forts and the reasons why.  There was plenty of enjoyably walking to be done to see the significant parts of the island complex.  The views were excellent, too.  The ferry was an easy and pleasant way to get there.",1
147,"This is on the site of ""things one must do in Helsinki"", but other that respecting the historical nostalgia of the Finnish defense of invaders from Sweden and Russia, this held nothing for me except to expand my imagination. The queues for the WCs are almost intolerable, and the stenches from inside the WC are intolerable. The photos of the ""guards and the prisoners"" in the physical labor in making this historical site is also a review of the political history of Finland (as in neighboring Russia) as the ""laborers"" are the defeated Finnish citizens of the ""red party"" and the guards are those of the victorious ""white party"".....Strange how history repeats itself. If one wants a historical understanding of the makings of Helsinki, this location will certainly provide that.",1
148,This is a must however the only downside is ticket touts and sales people trying to sell you gifts.  Too many people too close to each other during covid.  But once inside plenty of space and chance to see at your own pace.,0
149,Super beautiful area.nice walk lot of nature. Possibilities to eat out and some nice shops.its a must see in Strasbourg,0
150,"It's great to explore and walk, the street food is delicious, you'll have to be amazed about motorbikes here, crossing roads is a game. Worth exploring!",1
151,"Suomenlinna guards the only deep-water access to Helsinki. First the Swedes, then the Russians built fortifications all around several islands. At one point, the main island was home to a Russian merchant community - complete with Orthodox church.  The islands are dotted with bunkers, defensive stone walls (up to 12 meters thick), barracks, powder magazines, dozens of cannons, and even a small shipyard. Plus a museum, several restaurants, and a few shops. An open-air theater operates here in summer, as well.  Main pathways are mostly gravel or stone... so wear comfortable shoes. And, like most of Helsinki, the islands are hilly. There's even a small beach accessible in warmer months.  It's a wonderful place for a hike. But carry a jacket for when the wind picks up. Expect to spend at least half a day exploring.  Bonus: If you buy a transit card, the ferry is included.",1
152,"+ Just plainly a beautiful place! very great details everywhere  - They were under renovation, so some part we could not see much",1
153,History in the eyes of the viewer. It was marvelous to walk between the walls of the gladiators and old Rome.,0
154,Lifeguards every few hundred feet.  Lots of hotels and businesses provide umbrellas and chairs.  Tons of restaurants nearby for lunch.,1
155,"It being easily situated outside the Dubai Mall and the Burj Khalifa, made our visit very enjoyable as the fountain show happens every 30 minutes. So if you miss it once, you can catch again soon.",0
156,"Walk there all evening long after a day at work on a business trip. The walk along the river is wonderful. Peaceful and if you like to take pictures, this is a real treat! Typical Alsacian houses all over the place, beautiful flowers ... This definitely is a place to discover!",0
157,"We chose to take a tax from our hotel in Beijing. The driver helped us buy our tickets and gave us directions on where to go.  It is quite a walk - steep in parts, to get to the cable car station. We chose to go up the cable car to Tower 14 and then walk to Tower 6 and get the toboggan slide back down. Both were good and the queues weren't too big.  The wall is very busy at Tower 14 buy got quieter as we walked along it. It is very steep in parts so may not suite those who are less able.  The Toboggan ride was great fun ( you can take a chairlift down if you want) and we were allowed on it despite the age limit being 60!",1
158,Great canals and bridges makes Strasbourg a perfect place to enjoy the canals and. Ridges of Strasbourg. Little France is ideal photo taking and enjoy the peaceful river run around the island of Strasbourg. la petite France is better than little Venice in Colmar.  It has more canals and the surrounding timber houses compliments the river nice with vibrant colors. Enjoy the walk along the river and enjoy the peaceful river.,0
159,"If you are in Venice, then San Marco must be one of the reasons! Beautiful and Serene. Busy all the time but can't skip it! Be there at sunset, it's just mind blowing to see the reflection of colors and the shades of red off the cathedral",0
160,"Wasn't too packed. Wasn't to keen on paying 3 euro each to go there either (thanks idiot bad tourists). Check it out before Italians get driven out by foreigners. Sad sight really. Been back and few times, first visit was back in 2001and slowly it's losing it's historic appeal all in the name of greed. If you sit at one of the cafes there, READ the menu for any/all charges. Ask questions BEFORE you sit down or you can be one of people that pays 100 euro for an espresso and brioche. Nice to see/people watch, but I prefer to stay away from touristy sites and just wonder off the beaten patch",0
161,The piazza is magical  especially at night when the orchestras are playing at the cafes that surround the square. From dusk onwards the piazza takes on an entirely  different  personality and everyone should try to experience  this. I also go early in the morning before the tour buses and cruise ship tourists arrive . The piazza is quiet and the early morning light is lovely for photography.,1
162,"Splendid view of the Great Wall winding and cladding onto the mountain ranges like a dragon! To start, get ready for the steep walk up to the cable car station. The Wall walk itself is not as challenging as anticipated as you can stop and rest for photo shoots while enjoying the rolling view of the Wall.",1
163,"Hanoi Old Quarter, really helpful folks, Old streets offer all sorts of products, food, and nature very beautiful... Therefore in case you arrive at the existing Quarter, I suggest you try eco-friendly rice, meat Beef, chicken noodle soup, then hotpot tend to be unique food items in Hanoi in Vietnam and around the planet.",1
164,"Strasbourg is a French-German infusion and you truly see the German influences in Petit France. The half-timbered buildings, the canal/river, the flowers, the cobbled streets... all of it is so picturesque. You can take a canal cruise if you'd like but we chose to walk around. Would recommend a half hour to an hour here if you're in town!",0
165,"The tour was really well organised and it is exactly as described under the previous reviews. No time wasted in stopping for shopping or having to wait for other people on the bus. The bus leaves around 8h sharp and arrives at the gates of Mutianyu gate around 9:30. There are some stops before you jump on the cable car to allow you to get water, use the toilet and get the tickets for everyone. Our tour guide named Michael ( real name wuan jun) did a pretty good job in describing the history of the Great Wall during the journey and while I was with him at the 14th tower. I had plenty of time to then walk all the way to the 23rd tower and back to have lunch around 14h. Definitely recommend for first time visitors!",0
166,Not much to say apart from: it exceeded our expectations. Useful to get the combined ticket with palatine hill and Roman forum.,1
167,"Hanoi old quarter is such an interesting place with a lot of local food stores, souvenir shops... It is a good experience to explore it at nighttime",1
168,"L.A. Petite France was absolutely charming, I’ve always wanted to visit Strasbourg and this area was just beautiful - well worth the 2 hour train ride from Paris for the day.",0
169,We booked a skip the line tour for our family with 3 young boys under 12 through the big bus company. Children were free and €27 each for the adults. It included a tour via an app on your mobile which was basic but did the job. Good value an amazing site to see inside and out and an amazing history. Well worth a visit,0
170,"Charm, history, and character just oozes from La Petite France.  Probably my favorite area in Strasbourg with great restaurants and fun walking areas.",1
171,This is heart and soul of Lucerne. The walkways on either side are nice with rows of trees lined up. Great place to relax especially in the evening.,1
172,"This is an excellent place to visit especially on a nice day. Be prepared to walk. The guided walking tour is also recommended. The museums are not very big but only if you are interested. At the main museum, there is a video that runs for around 25minutes. You will learn most about place if you watch the video and join the guided walking tour.",1
173,There is not a good visit to Venice without going to the San Marco Piazza. Nice! Beautiful little restaurants and a feeling of disbelief before so much beauty.,1
174,Magnifica praça ! Estamos na terceira viagem a Veneza e sempre descubro uma nova atração ! Experiencia única andar por essa grande praça! Magnificent square! We are on the third trip to Venice and I always discover a new attraction! Unique experience walking through this great square!,1
175,"very impressive even though there's still ongoing renovation works. was planning to visit it around noon, reached to see snaking queues all the way outside. a local told me the crowd thins out at 3pm. the queue was definitely shorter. a must visit!",0
176,Walk in and out of the alleys to see the real life in Hanoi.Lovely people always with a smile.See the bustling market with everything you could wish to buy.Moost of the food restaurants are on the street and the thousands of motorbikes cover the pavements making walking quite difficult at times but a great experience.,1
177,"You can easily spend two hours here, just strolling around the beautiful grounds. Add a museum or two and a beer or coffee at one of the many restaurants and you're in for a half day experience! Certainly worth it, as the only fee you pay to access the island is the 5 euro ferry ride that takes about 15 minutes! The museums are at an additional cost, of course!",1
178,"The age of this building build quality i was amazed looking at it how it would have been built without today,s tech would recomend to any one to visit this building",0
179,You cannot go to Venice and not visit Piazza San Marco because it's the main square of the city.  The shops and restaurants around are probably a bit too touristy but the place is nonetheless a must-see.  It was particularly quiet during the coronavirus scare but normally it's very full especially in the summer.,1
180,"Brilliant experience and lovely high tea, staff sang happy birthday and brought cake with candles all to the amazing backdrop of the ocean and city vista",1
181,"We visited the square by day and by night. It's impressive, also by night! Just avoid when it's too crowded.",0
182,For anyone visiting Helsinki. Free (well you have to pay for the ferry) and you can easily spend an entire day there!,0
183,a good place for a walk a scenic spot a good place to rest a good place to take a picture Just taking a walk along the lake is a relaxing place.  ???? ?? ? ??? ?? ? ???? ?? ? ???? ?? ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ? ???? ??? ????? ???.,1
184,"We took the chair lift up to the wall and the toboggan down. Though some steps were steep, we paced ourselves and where able to walk this section comfortable. The view was fantastic. At the base there is a range of food available, from Burger King through to more traditional cuisine,",0
185,The beach was not as clean as I remembered.  Got up early to watch the sunrise.  While watching the sun rise we picked up so much plastic.  Kind of sad.,0
186,Get ready to do lots of walking. You can walk 10 minutes or 2 hours and see plenty. The step just keep going up. There is a hand rail to use too. After you are finished hiking you can go take a rest at the gift shop. You can even get a cold beer or soda.,1
187,"Must visit place for sure, you will get the best views at night ! You have a lot of coffe bars to sit and enjoy the view",0
188,"I am a recent and new adherent for the pleasures of the lake boats and transports in this, my favorite tourist country. The boats are for scenic tourism and practical transport (part of the SBB national system).  Despite my numerous visits for hiking adventures, last year, I happened upon the boat across Lake Lucerne for a practical reason- best method of transportation,,, but what a great experience- please see my last year's review for the description of that experience.  So I decided that for this year's trip, a proper Lake Lucerne journey would be the start of my trip. The incredible crazy itinerary that I did was to land at Zurich Flughafen at 0810 and I was on the boat by 1012- fantastic quick 20 minutes from plane to train , and the boat landing is across the street from the train station.  Now I could not believe how many hundreds of people were admitted to that boat, but it did not sink nor collapse from the load. Being an overenthusiastic tourist, I did not sit for a moment- walking from one end to the other and one side to the other- taking all the photos that you can see her- linked to this review.  I can say it all in a few words- I loved it. It is so smooth; it is so classy; it is so professional; it is so romantic; it is so lovely; it is so scenic; it is so unique.  Hey- you can sit at a table and have a real meal (I didn't do that).  You can see the famous mountains from a different perspective (see my recent reviews of Mt. Pilatus and Mt. Rigi).  Note that the boat remains crowded until Vitznau, where about 200-300 people disembarked at one time.  I continued to Brunnen on a much more spacious craft.  Don't forget to go to the bow and the stern- to see the bell and to see the gigantic Swiss flag flapping in the breeze (see my photos).  I disembarked at Brunnen- another of the endless number of scenic Swiss villages (everywhere and including along lakes). From there it was a five hour train journey via the Bernina Express to St. Moritz (please read about that on my profile too).  What a glorious start of my annual visit!!  This lake boat excursion is so recommended... and if you can, go on the BAV- that is the paddle boat- you can see the machinery in action on the lower floor and you can also see the rapidly churning paddles that propel the boat.",1
189,"The 4 connected islands in Helsinki are good places to visit, try not to miss. The islands are not big, but prepare to spend at least half a day, if can, one full day better. Love the green and well maintained. Easy to walk around. other than its history and be a heritage site, it’s also a great place for picnic.",0
190,"Not much to say about the square other than that it is very pretty! We came during Carnevale, so it was jam packed, but still pretty. There are a lot of souvenir shops and restaurants surrounding the perimeter.",1
191,"Due to recent Covid issues, the place was deserted. Very few people. But that's good by the way as not long waiting queues and you can enjoy the remaining history of Rome as you wish.",0
192,It is a very spiritual place. The comfort and the calmness inside this place is amazing although people do a very loud Noise . It combines christian and Muslim culture in a very tremendous way. I enjoyed the tour there. The one bad thing is that there was a massive repairing and reconstruction work there.,1
193,Jolly little ferry ride over to this historic island.  Wear walking shoes and enjoy the flowering shrubs and wild-flowers.  So much of Finland's history is explained there.,0
194,Great and perfect place. Manager is soo good asif was so kind and great host.i will recommend it to anyone with kids .love the dessert,0
195,Amazing place with hundreds of years of historyµ.  The city started at the times on the Hunnes but thier ral splendor came in the middle ages when the trading was at its foremost.,1
196,"I’ve been fortunate to see this part of the wall three times and it never disappoints, especially with first time visitors. It’s an easy visit, and well worth a visit. If you go in the winter, it’s incredible. Cold, but pretty.",1
197,Rome cites the gladiators the capital of the ancient world a must visit Rome of the Colosseum Rome of the emperors ...... thanks Rome,0
198,"The lake is absolutely stunning and worth taking even a short boat journey up it.  We did a day trip to Weggis and the scenery was breath taking. If you have the time to go down to flüelen do it. The most beautiful sight, but that one does take 5.5hrs.  Loved Lucerne and would come back in a heart beat.",1
199,"This place actually was really amazing and a must visit place in Venice. The piazza was surrounded by Procuratie Vecchie building with its long arcade and the Basilica San Marco. There were some restaurants with live music, souvenir stalls and some other shops. At the piazza there were a lot of pigeons. Although it wasn't recommended to play with the pigeons but almost all tourist will not miss it. But, there were some people offered corns to give to the pigeons and after that they will claim a lot of money. Please ignore these people.",1
