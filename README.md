🎯 Novelty Seeking Recommendation System

📌 Project Overview

The Novelty Seeking Project is a machine learning–based recommendation system designed to provide users with novel suggestions instead of repetitive, overfamiliar recommendations. Unlike traditional recommender systems that focus mainly on user-item similarity, this project prioritizes exploration by introducing fresh, diverse, and serendipitous content.

The goal is to balance accuracy (relevant suggestions) with novelty (new experiences)—helping users discover content they might not have found otherwise.
